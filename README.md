- this is a practice project I use to learn nextjs
- i read from the docs, and use Claude Code to dive deep into concepts until i understood it, and i practice the concept in this project
- when i have an insight or after i've understood something, i ask Claude Code to dump my learning into `./notes.md`
- it is great because it acts as a thought partner that i can go back and forth with until i reach an understanding, and the notes it writes are customized to my learning style
- and whenever i want to dive into another concept later in the future, i can have Claude Code read the dumped notes to customzed the explanation to my learning
- there is also two other toturials in `./deployment-architecture.md` and `high-traffic.md`
- additionally, there is an `./exam-1.md` file, which is generated by Claude Code based on my notes and https://github.com/mrhrifat/nextjs-interview-questions
